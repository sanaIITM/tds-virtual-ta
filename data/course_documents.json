    "text": "Tools in Data Science - Jan 2025 \n Tools in Data Science  is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches\npopular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production. \n \n This course exposes you to real-life tools \n\nCourses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\n\nBut one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\n\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\n\n- You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself.\n- You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace.\n- You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes.\n\n[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) \"We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.\"](https://explainxkcd.com/224/)\n\nIn this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science.\n\nLearn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers.\n\n \n \n This course is quite hard \n\nHere's students' feedback:\n\n- It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6)\n- Now it's hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/45)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t1-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-may-2024-term/127856/60)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t2-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-september-2024-term/144976/62?u=s.anand)\n- Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/11)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/4)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/7)\n- LLMs grade you -- unpredictably.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/10)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/wrong-marks-in-project-2/160355/9)\n- The ROE is hard.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/is-it-fair-to-consider-20-weightage-of-such-exam-which-is-impossible-to-solve-in-given-time-i-e-roe/141413/10)\n\n**[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) to check if you're ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.\n\n \n \n Programming skills are a pre-requisite \n\nYou need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.\n\n**But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\n\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\n\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them.\n\n \n \n We encourage learning by sharing \n\nYou _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\n**Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.\n\n**To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.\n\n**To learn better, teach** what you've learnt.\n\n \n We cover 7 modules in 12 weeks \n The content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the  commit history  for changes. \n Released content: \n \n Development Tools  and concepts to  build  models and apps.  Discussion Thread \n Deployment Tools  and concepts to  publish  what you built.  Discussion Thread \n Large Language Models  that make your work easier and your apps smarter.  Discussion Thread \n Data Sourcing  to get data from the web, files, and databases.  Discussion Thread \n Data Preparation  to clean up and convert the inputs to the right format.  Discussion Thread \n \n Project 1  to build an LLM-based automation agent.  Discussion Thread \n Work in progress: \n \n Data Analysis  to find surprising insights in the data. \n Data Visualization  to communicate those insights as visual stories. \n \n Evaluations are mostly open Internet \n | Exam                                                                       | Type                              | Weight |      Release Date |   Submission Date |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -----: | ----------------: | ----------------: |\n| GA: Graded assignments                                                     | Best 4 out of 7 \u2021                 |    15% |                   |                   |\n|  Graded Assignment 1      | Online open MCQ                   |        |       30 Dec 2024 |       26 Jan 2025 |\n|  Graded Assignment 2      | Online open MCQ                   |        |        3 Jan 2025 |        2 Feb 2025 |\n|  Graded Assignment 3      | Online open MCQ                   |        |       15 Jan 2025 |        5 Feb 2025 |\n|  Graded Assignment 4      | Online open MCQ                   |        |       31 Jan 2025 |        9 Feb 2025 |\n|  P1: Project 1                                            | Take-home open-Internet           |    20% |       19 Jan 2025 |       16 Feb 2025 |\n|  Graded Assignment 5      | Online open MCQ                   |        |        7 Feb 2025 |       21 Feb 2025 |\n|  Graded Assignment 6                                                  | Online open MCQ                   |        |       28 Feb 2025 |       16 Mar 2025 |\n|  P2: Project 2                                            | Take-home open-Internet           |    20% |        3 Mar 2025 |       31 Mar 2025 |\n|  Graded Assignment 7                                                  | Online open MCQ                   |        |       14 Mar 2025 |       26 Mar 2025 |\n|  ROE: Remote Online Exam  | Online open-Internet MCQ          |    20% | 02 Mar 2025 13:00 | 02 Mar 2025 13:45 |\n| F: Final end-term                                                          | In-person, no internet, mandatory |    25% |       13 Apr 2025 |                   | \n Updates \n \n 13 Jan 2025: GA3 release date moved from 10 Jan 2025 to 15 Jan 2025 due to faculty delay.

Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now. \n \u2021  Graded Assignments: Best 4 out 7 . We'll take the best 4 out of your graded assignments submissions. These, combined, will have a 15% weightage. \n Remote exams are open and hard \n You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets... \n The RoE is especially hard. Read:  What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam? \n Final exam is in-person and closed book . It tests your memory. It's easy. \n Projects test application . The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context. \n Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse . See  previous bonus activities \n Evaluations are mostly automated . This course uses pre-computed (for objective) or LLMs (for subjective) evaluations. \n LLMs will evaluate you differently each time.
