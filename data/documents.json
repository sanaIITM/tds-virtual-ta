The live sessions are really good  but , they are being conducted too close to the deadline (started on 10th June). In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I don\u2019t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency. \n Aside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow. I have to spend time finding other alternatives to create embeddings before I make the final submission with the openAI api. So, I humbly request, if it is possible, please consider extending the deadline by a few days. There is not enough time to absorb what was taught in the live sessions and implement it as complete beginner. \n Thank you.",

Such ambiguity in the evaluation process is concerning and leads to confusion and unfair penalization of students. \n I respectfully request that you review this matter and ensure that the evaluation criteria are consistent across the evaluation scripts. Denying marks due to technical discrepancies in the evaluation scripts, rather than the correctness of the SQL query itself, is unjust. This issue has severe repercussions: If unresolved, it will unjustly lower my overall course grade despite submitting a correct solution. Such an outcome, resulting from no fault of my own, is deeply concerning and undermines the fairness of the evaluation process.

Oh how wrong was I!! \n The sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it\u2019s just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I\u2019ve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir. \n  sir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable. \n      I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t an easy task being the TA of this course. Thanks for all the help throughout the term with the Mock ROEs, project sessions and clearing doubts in discourse and live sessions. \n I still got an S grade but it was a very hard-fought S with the help of some luck.

However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers. \n I have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows: \n \n Question 2: Fields needed to filter \u201cPOST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays\u201d \n To filter such logs, we need: \n Time \u2192 for the hour and the day (Monday) \nMethod \u2192 to filter POST \nURL \u2192 to filter /images/ \n So, the correct minimal set is: \n \n  Time, Method, URL \n \n Time \u2192 needed  \nMethod \u2192 needed  \nURL \u2192 needed  \nReferer \u2192 not needed, but not harmful \n So this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra \u2014 which doesn\u2019t invalidate it. \n \n Acc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid: \n Status is numeric (200) \nMethod (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct \n All required fields are present and properly formatted \n The other options were as follows: \n 9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID) \n 9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric) \n 9824 has no critical issue \u2014 it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827 \n \nCorrect Answer(s): \n  PUT \u2013 Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result. \n  GET \u2013 Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result. \n  DELETE \u2013 Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted). \n \n Incorrect Answer: \n  POST \u2013 Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state. \n (This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved) \n Thank you",

The TDS roe exam is almost impossible to solve within the given time frame. While the team might aim to develop certain skills in students, I would like you to consider this: having an exam that is nearly impossible to complete in the allotted time which is a statement by your side\u2026 \n My question is, why is this exam graded and carrying  20% weightage towards the final grade? Is this fair? we are loosing marks for the exam in which almost no one can score average. This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly. I request the team to consider this issue. Either make this exam ungraded or reduce its weightage.

    "text": "Dear      \n First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the  TDS team  in supporting us throughout this course. The  live sessions and guidance  have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. \n However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. \n Key Challenges Faced \n   Lack of Prerequisites \n This course did not list any  prerequisites , leading many students\u2014including those from  non-technical backgrounds \u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the  course content, assignments, and projects  have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. \n   Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure \n The  difficulty of the projects  has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to  rely heavily on peer support  just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. \n   Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback \n Many students joined  TDS  based on past  Discourse posts and feedback , which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for  working professionals  and students without prior experience. \n   Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) \n While we have put in significant effort\u2014spending  2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)  to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves  struggling to meet expectations  for the  projects and RoE , which are significantly harder than anticipated. \n We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. \n We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. \n Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.",

I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is.

In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike.
